            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the 
            printing <br>and typesetting industry. 
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
            standard dummy text ever since the 
            1500s, when an unknown printer took a 
            galley of type and scrambled it to make 
            a type specimen book. It has survived 
            not only five centuries, but also the 
            leap into electronic typesetting,
             <hr>
             <p> remaining essentially unchanged. 
                It was popularised in the 1960s with 
                the release of Letraset sheets 
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                and more recently with desktop <hr></p>
